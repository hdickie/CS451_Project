I. Protein Homology
	This folder contains most of the project code

	A. LDA.R
		This is the R script of LDA
	B. Protein Homology.Rmd
		R markdown file of the compilation of R scripts of the "good" models fitted using R (to be updated)
	C. Protein_Homology.html
		The knitted html
	D. Random_Forest and SVM.py
		Python script of the random forest and svm
	E. predictor_selection.R
		Includes initial fitting of the models then selects the predictors to be used
	F. vmCS451.R
		R script of the RF and SVM
	G. unsupervised.R
		R scrips of PCA and Heirarchical clustering code but wasn't significant
	H. upsampling attempts.R
		Initial code using logistic regression and umsampling

II. Logistic results.xlsx
	This file contains the tables and figures of the accuracies of the models used

III. Random Forest Results with Logistic results for comparison .xlsx
	This file contains the necessary accuracies found forom the Logistic and RF models

IV. skewness.R
	This is a trial on upsampling and downsampling the data then fitting logistic models to is.
